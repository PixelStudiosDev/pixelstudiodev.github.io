# Wool Wars

## What is Wool Wars?

Wool Wars is a round-based minigame in which two or more teams fight to fill the central area of the arena with wool.
The team with the most points wins the match. You can obtain special effects and perks from powerups that spawn in the
arena. Before the start of each round players can choose a kit, which also has a special ability that can be used once.

## Where can I buy the plugin?
